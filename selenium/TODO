Things to do for complete automated testing of asp.net:

 Tese cases:
     * Complete thorough test cases for xsp1
     * Complete thorough test cases for xsp2
     * Complete thorough test cases for mojoportal
     * Complete thorough test cases for graffiti
     * Complete thorough test cases for asp.net apps

 Framework features:
     * Optimize to use testopia batch calls
     * Add warnings for test cases that weren't run because they're not in the testopia test run
     * Add cmd that will only re-run failed tests in the test run
     * Added cmd line option that will set isautomated=True in Testopia on all test cases that are run
     * Implement logging module for better debug output


BUGS

FUTURE
 * Integrate Selenium Grid


DONE
 * Restructured xsp1 test case to be more friendly
 * Move the creds.py file to ~/.testopia_credentials so that we don't accidentally check in our creds to svn.
 * Fix command line parameters not working
 * Added script/args values to automation section of the test cases in Testopia that we can use
 * Integrate bugzilla python xmlrpc to mark tests as pass/fail
 * Investigate Testopia.testcaserun_update(update_bugs=True) 
        - DO NOT WANT - It reopens ALL associated bugs.
 * Catch protocol error (password display)
 * Fix --testrunid option
