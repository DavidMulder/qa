Things to do for complete automated testing of asp.net:

 * Complete thorough test cases for xsp1
 * Complete thorough test cases for xsp2
 * Complete thorough test cases for mojoportal
 * Complete thorough test cases for graffiti
 * Complete thorough test cases for asp.net apps
 
 * Add warnings for test cases that weren't run because they're not in the testopia test run

 * Added cmd line option that will set isautomated=True on all test cases that are run

DONE
 * Added script/args values to automation section of the test cases in Testopia that we can use
 * Integrate bugzilla python xmlrpc to mark tests as pass/fail
 * Investigate Testopia.testcaserun_update(update_bugs=True) 
        - DO NOT WANT - It reopens ALL associated bugs.

FUTURE
 * Integrate Selenium Grid
